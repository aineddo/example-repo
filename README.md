GitHub Crash Course
Hello World!

Some notes taken from the course

.md = markdown
ctrl l clears the tab on BASH

simple clone command doesnt make it go to the cloud and make it appear on your github profile

use command 'git status' and appearing read file name = untracked file

even so, git could know any changes made wheter you add, delete or edit the file.

the stage process = send to Git cloud (comitting)

use command git 'add README.md (basically the file name)' the file will appear green which mean it is staged but not sent to github yet.

after this step u will see No commits yet therefore use command 'commit -m' m stands for message 

'git push origin main' is the command that oing to push it to the github. some uses master instead of main but nowadays its main that has been used widely

local means its on your computer and only use can use it.
